## __Application Summary__
Weight tracker app purpose is to allow its users to set goals and track its progress. User would be able to set weight goal and add current weight daily. App users would receive notifications when their goal is achieved. App requirements includes a multi-user access with display of daily progress inside grid.

------------
## __Application Design__
To meet all requirements application should have two screens. One screen would allow users to login or register, and second screen would display daily progress. My design allows users a quick access to the main features of the apps. User with single click could set new goal and add or update daily weights. My design was successful at displaying user progress in the past ten days.

------------
## __Coding Approach__
My coding approach included creation of separate classes that would handle a specific set of tasks. With this approach majority of written code could be reused in different projects. Each active UI element had appropriate listeners setup to perform functionality when being activated. 

------------
## __Code Testing__
All application functionality was tested after it implemented. Once set of features were complete, all possible use variations were performed. Since the app is required to track daily weigh progress, i used manual setting of date to make sure that new day weight is being added inside grid. When adding weight for the day that was already inside grid it would perform update of the weight.

------------
## __Development Challenges__
One of the main challenges that i had to overcome is display of daily progress. Since it could take a long period of time to meet the final goal, displaying data for all those days would take bunch of resources. I have chosen to display up to last ten days of weight tracking. Future improvements would include grid scrolling to show users entire progress from start to end.

------------
## __Successful Components of the Application__
Best component of the app that demonstrates my knowledge, skill and experience is login screen. It provides a clear information to the user and assist them during the process of entering main screen. I make sure that login screen UI and functionality meet all requirements by providing ability to login or register new account.
